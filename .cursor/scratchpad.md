# Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

We've successfully enhanced our Farcaster-based dating app with a new feature that shows users who they don't currently follow but have high portfolio overlap (shared onchain interests). This has replaced the previous implementation that simply showed the first 5 followers. Additionally, when a user "likes" a profile, they now follow that user on Farcaster using the Neynar API.

This feature has made the app more useful as a way to discover and connect with like-minded individuals in the Farcaster ecosystem based on shared onchain activity and interests.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Neynar API Integration**: We've integrated with the Neynar API for both fetching suggested follows and implementing the follow action. This required proper API key management, authentication, and error handling.

2. **Signer Management**: Following a user on Farcaster requires creating and managing a signer that must be approved by the user. We've implemented a robust system to handle signer creation, approval flows, and persistence.

3. **Portfolio Overlap**: We've leveraged our existing portfolio overlap calculation system and combined it with suggested follows from Neynar to create a personalized recommendation system.

4. **Asynchronous Flows**: The signer approval process involves multiple steps with waiting periods, which required careful state management to ensure a good user experience.

5. **Error Handling and Fallbacks**: We've implemented proper error handling and fallbacks for various API failures, network issues, and edge cases.

6. **Caching Strategy**: To minimize redundant API calls and improve performance, we've implemented proper caching for suggested follows and portfolio data.

7. **User Experience**: The transition from "like" to "follow" is now intuitive and provides clear feedback to the user about what is happening.

8. **Rate Limit Management**: Since we're on the Neynar Starter plan, we've ensured we stay within the rate limits of 300 RPM per endpoint and 500 RPM globally by implementing rate limiting strategies.

9. **Performance Optimization**: We've implemented strategies to ensure the app remains responsive while providing rich functionality, despite the potentially long-running operations of fetching suggested follows and calculating portfolio overlap.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

I've fixed two critical issues that were preventing the application from working correctly:

1. **Mock Data Override**: The API was always using mock data in development mode because of a condition that checked `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`. This prevented the real Neynar API from being used. I modified the condition to only use mock data when explicitly requested via the `useMockData` query parameter.

2. **Signer Storage Mismatch**: There was an inconsistency in how signer information was being stored and retrieved:
   - The `neynar.ts` utility functions were storing signer info inside the farcasterUser object in localStorage
   - The Card component was using a separate `signer_${userFid}` key to store and retrieve signer info
   
   I updated the Card component to use the proper utility functions (`getSignerInfo`, `isSignerValid`) to maintain consistent signer storage. I also fixed the signer interfaces to ensure type safety.

The application now correctly:
- Uses real Neynar API data when `useMockData` is not set to true
- Consistently stores and retrieves signer information using the proper utilities
- Correctly handles the follow flow using the authorized signer

These fixes should resolve the issues with suggested follows and signer errors.

### User Specified Lessons

* Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
* Read the file before you try to edit it.
* If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
* Always ask before using the -force git command

### Implementation Lessons

* When working with Next.js API routes, avoid importing modules that mix CommonJS and ES Module syntax
* For better compatibility, it's sometimes cleaner to reimplement utility functions directly in the API route

* Storing authentication state in localStorage can be extended to include API-specific tokens like Neynar signers
* Progressive loading and multi-layered caching are essential for features that combine multiple data sources
* Windowing and pagination techniques can significantly improve performance for list-based UIs
* Rate limiting should be implemented at the application level to stay within API provider limits
* When developing and testing APIs, it's useful to create mock data responses for reliable testing
* Adding debugging information to API responses helps track down issues during development
* For third-party APIs that might be unreliable, always implement fallback responses
* Environment variables might not be available in all environments, so always check before using
* Modifying existing components requires careful consideration of props and interfaces

* When working with third-party APIs, always make sure to pass all required parameters
* Mock data is crucial for testing, but make sure to enable real API calls in production
* Be careful with environment-based conditions (like NODE_ENV) that might override intended behavior
* Ensure consistent data storage patterns across components when working with persisted data
* Use type definitions and interfaces for better type safety, especially with external APIs
* React's useCallback and dependency arrays are essential for preventing excessive API calls
* When storing auth tokens, use a consistent pattern throughout the application
